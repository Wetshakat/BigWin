🎰 BigWin — Digital Lottery Platform on Starknet

Tagline: Play Fair. Win Big. Anytime.

1. Overview

BigWin is a next-generation digital lottery platform built on Starknet, designed to deliver fairness, transparency, and seamless user participation.

The platform enables players to enter automated lottery rounds where participants compete for a shared prize pool, with smart contracts governing the entire lifecycle of each round.

Core Mechanics

Each round accommodates up to 50 players

New rounds open automatically as users join

Rounds conclude when:

Player capacity is reached, or

A predefined time limit expires

Winner selection is executed transparently on-chain

2. The Problem

Traditional and Web2 lottery systems suffer from structural inefficiencies:

2.1 Trust Deficit

Players must rely on centralized operators to pick winners fairly, with limited transparency into draw mechanisms.

2.2 Participation Bottlenecks

Rounds may remain open indefinitely if participant thresholds aren’t met, delaying outcomes.

2.3 Rigid Entry Structures

Fixed entry windows and participation constraints reduce engagement and accessibility.

3. Our Solution

BigWin leverages Starknet’s scalability and verifiability to solve these challenges:

Provable Fairness
Winner selection and round execution occur via audited smart contracts.

Transparent Operations
All entries, prize pools, and outcomes are verifiable on-chain.

Flexible Round Completion
Rounds finalize based on player count or time expiry.

Continuous Gameplay
New rounds spawn automatically after completion.

User-Centric UX
Simple interface to join rounds, monitor participation, and view winners.

4. How It Works
